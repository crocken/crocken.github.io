## Howdy!

The Bridge2Hyku grant (<a href="https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-70-17-0217-17">LG-70-17-0217-17</a>) project is up and running at the University of Houston and is beginning to take shape. With a new content strategist on board, the team of web developers and metadata librarians is using agile and scrum techniques to plan the short- and mid- term goals for the project.  

If you'd like to be a part of this community effort to help build best practices for migrations into Hyku, please visit the contact link, or fill out our migration survey!
